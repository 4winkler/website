               of the DARPA Learning Locomotion challenge and extend it to 
               allow more flexibility and increased robustness. During 
               execution we incorporate an on-line force-based foothold 
               adaptation mechanism that updates the planned motion according 
               to the perceived state of the environment. This way we exploit

               stiff robotic system. We leverage the full set of benefits
