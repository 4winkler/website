  <h5 class="card-title">Must have apps</h5>
	<p>
	Having internet on the road makes travelling so much easier. So when arriving at an airport, I'd buy a prepaid SIM card for about 20$ with 15GB highspeed LTE. These are my favorites: 
	</p> 

	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google Maps</a>: This was the number one on my homescreen (sorry maps.me evangelists^^). Especially the "offline maps" options is great when travelling to a new country where you don't have data yet. Also great to search for ATMs, restaurants and to save your hidden gems.
		</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/">Hostelworld</a>: I prefer to stay at least 3 nights per hostel, as things usually get better (you get to know people, location). I avoided hostels with names that end with an animal, since they are usually Party Hostels (termed "Atmosphere" on Hostelworld). Don't book anything more than 3 nights ahead. Pick hostels a bit away from center to connect with older (30ish) travelers.
		</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.couchsurfing.com/">Couchsurfing</a>: Even if you don't want to crash on someone's couch, checkout the Hangouts feature to spontaneously meet with other travellers.
		</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.grab.com/">Grab</a>: The Uber equivalent of SE-Asia. Make sure to add your CC in the app beforehand. Then, as soon as you have internet, you're mobile! They also have scooters to pick you up, which is great budget option if you travel with little luggage.
		</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.go-jek.com/">GoJek</a> (Food): If in Bali, use this app to get dinner delievered to your home for only 1$ extra.
		</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Some lessons learned?</h4> 
<p>
I'm so privileged and have so many options. Nobody has cars here. 
How difficult it can be for ppl with other passports and less money to travel.
So many simultaneous lives going on at this instance arround the world and we're top of the foodchain.
</p>


<p>
Everyone is busy with their own life. People don't really think about you that often. This is not meant in a bitter, negative sense, but as encouragement to stop obsessing about trying to please others. You're on a large stage but the entire audience is just looking at their smartphone answering emails, because they also got shit to do, that's fine. 
You can do whatever I want, just as other people are going their way, thinking about their own problems. This includes your parents and friends, they'll love and support you, but ultimately this is a path you walk alone, so make your own decisions.
</p>


<p>
Whereas previously 70% of my conversation involved robotics, now only the occasional facebook post reminded me of my profession. And seeing a new robotics paper now seems a bit less...important. I'm still very interested in the scientific aspects, but academic research is so far removed from life of the non-researcher. In the travel-bubble (also very much a bubble), people mostly talk about the places they visited, the things they experienced, the people they met. My citations or journals don't interest anyone in this environment. 
</p>


<p>
I smoked occasionally at the beginning of the travel, as many people in the backpacking community do. I understood that my main reason for smoking was that I enjoyed being able to stand somewhere doing nothing without looking stupid. It was an introvert thing. So I was mostly missing the self-confidence to just idly stand at the edge of a party. Instead of smoking I will work on my self-confidence. I hate hangovers. That's why I rarely drank more than a few beer. But if 8 beer cause a terrible hangover, indicating that my body is harmed by alcohol, then one beer still harms my body 1/8 of the terrible hangover. Even if I don't feel it. I'll only accept this health-hazard, if the alcohol I'm drinking is delicious and there's no non-alcoholic alternative. Therefore I'm forever done with shots (juck!) and beer and whine are replaced by tasty fresh-juice. Still looking for an alternativee to a a delicious mojito or gin&tonic ;) 
</p>

<p>
How lively the streets are (also a night) and how much more people are socializing compared to "developed countries". Money brings isolation? Really noticed in the states how empty streets are, it's car to work, to house.

<p>
How many people are currently travelling or working remotely. That that's a life one can have and choose.
</p>



<h4>Some other things I learned</h4>
<ul>
	<li>America was the bad guy in Vietnam war.</li>
	<li>Plastic waste is a real issue in Bali. Paddled out through dirty water in Canggu.</li>
	<li>Top bunk bed is not better than bottom bed.</li>
	<li>Sharing a room with other people is not problem.</li>
	<li>Partying is really not fun for me anymore.</li>
	<li>4 males can fit on one scooter</li>
	<li>SE-Asia is extremely safe. Not one criminal incident in 6 months. Also never used a locker in the dorms (just a lock on my bag) and never had anything stolen.  
</ul>

<h4>Most experience of freedom and explorer mindset</h4>
<p>
Generally sitting on buses/trains/boats looking out the window and seeing the world pass by. It gave me a peculiar feeling of possibility. That I can go anywhere for a few bucks, do anything. This feeling of not beeing constrained. This urge that I'm obliged to use it and not let it go to waste.
Sitting in Bus driving to Pai listening to <insert song here> looking out the window, felt freeing, because I didn't plan going there until bying a ticket on the spot.
Walking/Jogging around in totally strange Phnom Phen, felt like in an amusement park (Monks just walking around).
</p>



<h4>Was loneliness an issue?</h4>
<p>
Not so much for me. Sightseeing/exploring I prefer to do with other people. Going to a restaurant I also have no problem going alone. Especially breakfast I actually prefer alone with a a book. BUT, the regular visits as well as great skype talks with friends and family always made me feel connected. Technology ftw!
</p>


<h4>What will I do differently next time?</h4>
<p>
I noticed that six months of pure travelling/sightseeing is quite long. 3 weeks every 6 months sight-seeing vacations are enough. Pick one country and go all-in, hostel, social, tours. The other time stay in a place with routine, and work efficiently on something (optimally this is my job) and do sports, e.g. surfing. Because pure travel can be exhausting and conversely, working efficiently and doing sports is difficult on the road.
