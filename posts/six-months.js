  <h5 class="card-title">Must have travel apps</h5>
	<p>
	Having internet on the road makes travelling so much easier. So when arriving at an airport, I'd buy a prepaid SIM card for about 20$ with 15GB highspeed LTE. These are my favorite travel apps: 
	</p> 

	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google Maps</a>: The number one on my homescreen (sorry maps.me evangelists^^). Especially the "offline maps" options is great when travelling to a new country where you don't have data yet. Also great to search for ATMs, restaurants and to save your hidden gems.
		</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/">Hostelworld</a>: I prefer to stay at least 3 nights per hostel, as things usually get better (you get to know people, location). I avoided hostels with names that end with an animal, since they are often Party Hostels (termed "Atmosphere" on Hostelworld). I rarely booked more than a day in advance to stay flexible. Picking hostels a bit away from center helps connect with older (30ish) travelers.
		</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.couchsurfing.com/">Couchsurfing</a>: Even if you don't want to crash on someone's couch, checkout the Hangouts feature to spontaneously meet with other travellers.
		</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.grab.com/">Grab</a>: The Uber equivalent of SE-Asia. Make sure to add your CC in the app beforehand. Then, as soon as you have internet, you're mobile! They also have scooters to pick you up, which is a great budget option if you travel with little luggage.
		</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.go-jek.com/">GoJek</a> (Food): If in Bali, use this app to get dinner delievered to your home for only 1$ extra.
		</li>

<h4>Some lessons learned?</h4>
<h6>I'm so privileged</h6>
<p>
This first one is so cliche, I considered leaving it out, but I think it's one of my most important realizations. How effortlessly I could save enough money to fly and experience a foreign country, compared to how much more difficult it would be for the college graduate from Phnom Phen to backpack through Europe. And I'm not just privileged in terms of money, but also options. Merely because I was born at the specific patch of earth to get a German Passport, I'm able to enter so many countries with so little bureucratic effort. I didn't earn this, do anything for it, that's also just given to me. 

On top of money and open-doors to foreign countries, another privilege is environment. Although an education at a reknowned university doesn't guarantee professional success, it does increase the chances (if only connecting you with influencial people or convince company recruiters who put a disproportionate value on <em>where</em> you got your degree from). I have no doubt that there are equally capable kids as me in the schools in Cambodia or Vietnam, but if I imagine the challenges they would have to overcome to e.g. study at ETH Zurich: One of the hardest things is to even recognize that as a possibility, because you must do something so radically different than your parents, peers, environment. Then, they have to convince universities of their potential with a foreign report card in a system most recruiters can't accurately judge. On top of that, money and Visa will be huge issues. 
</p>


<p>
Everyone is busy with their own life. People don't really think about you that often. I don't say this in a bitter, negative sense, quite the contrary. It takes the pressure off, like talking on a conference call, but the entire audience is just answering emails on their smartphone, because they also got shit to do and that's fine. Do whatever you want. At the same time you alone must take full responsiblity for your decisions. Don't make a decision that you'll be stuck with 100% of the time, based on the expectations, sentiments, beliefs of other people that might only be impacted by it 1% of the time. They don't have the skin in the game.
</p>


<p>
Your environment strongly influences what you view as important. In the last 4 years I nodded in admiring recognition when someone got published in IJRR instead of "just" RA-L, found it self-evident to dedicate months of my life to optimize not just step-timings, but the gait sequence, had hour-long discussions on the crucial importance of modelling the effects of leg motions on body accelerations. It was super exciting to work on these challenges, but I forget how much of a niche I'm really in. And sometimes you might overblow the effect your research matters to the world. Of course I stomped from the academic robotics bubble right into the backpacker-bubble instead, where dinner conversations revolved about countries visited, breathtaking places you gotta see, local food you must try and that you don't want to go back home. Seeing what people view as important in this enviroment, combined with my previous bubbles, possibly gave me a more holistic perspective. In any case, there are many more bubbles to sample.  
</p>


<p>
I smoked occasionally at the beginning of the travel, as many people in the backpacking community do. I understood that my main reason for smoking was that I enjoyed being able to stand somewhere doing nothing without looking stupid. It was an introvert thing. So I was mostly missing the self-confidence to just idly stand at the edge of a party. Instead of smoking I will work on my self-confidence. I hate hangovers. That's why I rarely drank more than a few beer. But if 8 beer cause a terrible hangover, indicating that my body is harmed by alcohol, then one beer still harms my body 1/8 of the terrible hangover. Even if I don't feel it. I'll only accept this health-hazard, if the alcohol I'm drinking is delicious and there's no non-alcoholic alternative. Therefore I'm forever done with shots (juck!) and beer and whine are replaced by tasty fresh-juice. Still looking for an alternativee to a a delicious mojito or gin&tonic ;) 
</p>

<p>
How lively the streets are (also a night) and how much more people are socializing compared to "developed countries". Money brings isolation? Really noticed in the states how empty streets are, it's car to work, to house.

<p>
How many people are currently travelling or working remotely. That that's a life one can have and choose.

<h4>Some other things I learned</h4>
<ul>
	<li>America was the bad guy in Vietnam war.</li>
	<li>Plastic waste is a real issue in Bali. Paddled out through dirty water in Canggu.</li>
	<li>Top bunk bed is not better than bottom bed.</li>
	<li>Sharing a room with other people is not problem.</li>
	<li>Partying is really not fun for me anymore.</li>
	<li>4 males can fit on one scooter</li>
	<li>SE-Asia is extremely safe. Not one criminal incident in 6 months. Also never used a locker in the dorms (just a lock on my bag) and never had anything stolen.  
</ul>

<h4>Most experience of freedom and explorer mindset</h4>
<p>
Generally sitting on buses/trains/boats looking out the window and seeing the world pass by. It gave me a peculiar feeling of possibility. That I can go anywhere for a few bucks, do anything. This feeling of not beeing constrained. This urge that I'm obliged to use it and not let it go to waste.
Sitting in Bus driving to Pai listening to <insert song here> looking out the window, felt freeing, because I didn't plan going there until bying a ticket on the spot.
Walking/Jogging around in totally strange Phnom Phen, felt like in an amusement park (Monks just walking around).
</p>



<h4>Was loneliness an issue?</h4>
<p>
Not so much for me. Sightseeing/exploring I prefer to do with other people. Going to a restaurant I also have no problem going alone. Especially breakfast I actually prefer alone with a a book. BUT, the regular visits as well as great skype talks with friends and family always made me feel connected. Technology ftw!
</p>


<h4>What will I do differently next time?</h4>
<p>
I noticed that six months of pure travelling/sightseeing is quite long. 3 weeks every 6 months sight-seeing vacations are enough. Pick one country and go all-in, hostel, social, tours. The other time stay in a place with routine, and work efficiently on something (optimally this is my job) and do sports, e.g. surfing. Because pure travel can be exhausting and conversely, working efficiently and doing sports is difficult on the road.
