<h4>Most valuable lessons learned?</h4>
<p>
I'm so privileged and have so many options. 
How difficult it can be for ppl with other passports and less money to travel.
So many simultaneous lives going on at this instance arround the world.
I'm often overprepared in terms of money, insurance, medial supply, fancy clothes (merione whool)... Many ppl did what I did with much less to start with, but still did it and managed. I can definetly take more risks. You don't have to plan a lot. I arrived in Saigon by Bus at night without money or internet and it still worked. Don't be so scared.
</p>

<p>
Everyone is busy with their own life. Not in a negative sense, but people don't really care what you do or think about you that often. That's also very freeing, because you start to understand you are alone and also can do whatever you want, nobody's really watching. And noone you really have to impress, because everyone thinks about themselves. Time goes on and some people do this, others that. There isn't THE optimal lifestyle, everyone has its own. For me I feel oppressed living in a small town in germany. I feel best when I'm among young people. I feel best when I'm in warm weather.
</p>

<p>
Seeing people advertise a new robotics paper seemed a bit less...important. As if I managed to break out of that current just a bit and get a bit more of an outsiders perspective. At least for me I think the things that are important are things outside Academia, making and building something, more that writing papers on it. It became more attractive to me.
</p>  

<p>
I learned that taking care of the body should have higher priority. I never really drunk much apart from the occasional beer. I did smoke more at the beginning of the travel, as everyone travelling does so (which is weird i think, many are well educated!). But at some point i felt it eating my body from the inside. I understood that my main reason for smoking was that I enjoyed being able to stand somewhere doing nothing without looking stupid. It was an introvert thing, I didn't have to talk but could still be part of a social happening. So maybe most people who smoke are missing self-confidence to just stand at the edge of the party doing nothing (and not looking at their phone). I also completely stopped drinking alcohol (except a nice cocktail), because I reallly don't like the taste and even small quantities harm your body, even if you don't directly feel it. I noticed how much I craved sugar and that I should also cut down on that to reduce risk for diabetes.
</p>

<p>
Travelling isn't neccessary to make you a better, more world-open person. I met a few interesting people, who just started their first travels a few days ago and impressed me in the genuonly curious way they engaged with the country, the people and the mindset they had. This trait was something they picked up at home, and they can be just as good an embassador for their country than the long-term traveler. In the same way, just because the natives you meet haven't travelled to other countries, really doesn't make them worse people in any way. 
</p> 



<h4>Something I changed my mind about through the 6 months travel?</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Partying is really not fun for me (anymore?). Or was it ever.</li>
	<li>America was bad in Vietnam war.</li>
	<li>Plastic waste is a top issue in Indonesia/Philipines. Paddled out through dirty water in Canggu.</li>
	<li>Top bunk bed is not better than bottom bed.</li>
</ul>



<h4>Most experience of freedom and explorer mindset</h4>
<p>
Generally sitting on buses looking out the window and seeing the world pass by. It gave me a peculiar feeling of possibility. That I can go anywhere for a few bucks, do anything. This feeling of not beeing constrained. This urge that I'm obliged to use it and not let it go to waste.
Sitting in Bus driving to Pai listening to <insert song here> looking out the window, felt freeing, because I didn't plan going there until bying a ticket on the spot.
Walking/Jogging around in totally strange Phnom Phen, felt like in an amusement park (Monks just walking around).
</p>



<h4>Was loneliness an issue?</h4>
<p>
Not for me, but this depends on the person. Sightseeing/exploring I prefer to do with other people. Going to a restaurant I also have no problem going alone. Especially breakfast I actually prefer alone with a a book. BUT, the regular visits as well as great skype talks with friends and family always made me feel connected. Technology ftw!
</p>



<h4>Some inspring people I've come in contact with</h4>
<p>
Woman running from Westborow Baptist Church, UK woman leaving home for NZ, Programmer working abroad, Sinag Hostel women starting a business (unprepared?)
</p> 



<h4>Random things that I stuck</h4>
<ul>
	<li>My Vietnamese roommate Huan explaining how to use a "Bum Gun".</li>
	<li>How lively the streets are (also a night) and how much more people are socializing compared to "developed countries". Money brings isolation?</li>
	<li>How helpful/efficient people where in Amed Bali and fixed our flat tire.</li>
</ul>




<h4>What will I do differently next time?</h4>
<p>
I noticed that 6 months of pure travelling/sightseeing is quite long. 3 weeks every 6 months sight-seeing vacations are enough. Pick one country and go all-in, hostel, social, tours. The other time stay in a place with routine, and work efficiently on something (optimally this is my job) and do sports. Because pure travel can be exhausting and conversely, working efficiently and doing sports is difficult on the road.

  <h5 class="card-title">Practical advice</h5>
	<p>
	Technology makes travelling sooo easy nowadays. The first thing when you arrive at a country/airport is get Cash and a Sim Card with Internet (about 20$ for 15GB).
	</p> 

	<h6>My most helpful apps</h6>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Google Maps</em>: This was the number one on my homescreen (sorry maps.me evangelists^^). Especially the "offline maps" options is great when travelling to a new country where you don't have data yet. Also great to search for ATMs, restaurants and to save your hidden gems.
		</li>
		<li><em>Hostelworld</em>: I prefer to stay at least 3 nights per hostel, as things usually get better (you get to know people, location). I avoided hostels with names that end with an animal, since they are usually Party Hostels (termed "Atmosphere" on Hostelworld). Don't book anything more than 3 nights ahead. Pick hostels a bit away from center to connect with older (30ish) travelers.
		</li>
		<li><em>Grab</em>: The Uber equivalent of SE-Asia. Make sure to add your CC in the app beforehand. Then, as soon as you have internet, you're mobile! They also have scooters to pick you up, which is great budget option if you travel with little luggage.
		</li>
		<li><em>GoJek</em> (Food): If in Bali, use this app to get dinner delievered to your home for only 1$ extra.
		</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Most adventurous/scared</h4>
<p>
Nothing at all happened (robbed, stolen).
Walking up to the top of the hill in Ninh Binh in the morning.
Scared when North Thailand guy came to bonfire, but as soon as he smiled, everything was okey :)
