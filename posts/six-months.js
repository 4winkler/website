<span class="first-letter">S</span>ix months of backpacking is over, and in this post I'm trying to retain some of the new reoccuring thoughts, insights or just curious moments during these travels. It turned out to be a super random collection, so don't be looking for the goldden thread, an agenda, a goal, just enjoy the journey ;)

  <h5 class="card-title">Must have travel apps</h5>
	<p>
	Having internet on the road makes travelling so much easier. So when arriving at an airport, I'd buy a prepaid SIM card for about 20$ with 15GB highspeed LTE. These are my favorite travel apps: 
	</p> 

	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google Maps</a>: The number one on my homescreen (sorry maps.me evangelists^^). Especially the "offline maps" options is great when travelling to a new country where you don't have data yet. Also great to search for ATMs, restaurants and to save your hidden gems.
		</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/">Hostelworld</a>: I prefer to stay at least 3 nights per hostel, as things usually get better (you get to know people, location). I avoided hostels with names that end with an animal, since they are often Party Hostels (termed "Atmosphere" on Hostelworld). I rarely booked more than a day in advance to stay flexible. Picking hostels a bit away from center helps connect with older (30ish) travelers.
		</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.couchsurfing.com/">Couchsurfing</a>: Even if you don't want to crash on someone's couch, checkout the Hangouts feature to spontaneously meet with other travellers.
		</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.grab.com/">Grab</a>: The Uber equivalent of SE-Asia. Make sure to add your CC in the app beforehand. Then, as soon as you have internet, you're mobile! They also have scooters to pick you up, which is a great budget option if you travel with little luggage.
		</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.go-jek.com/">GoJek</a> (Food): If in Bali, use this app to get dinner delievered to your home for only 1$ extra.
		</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Being grateful</h4>
<p>
This first one is so cliche, I considered leaving it out, but I think it's one of my most important realizations. How effortlessly I could save enough money to fly and experience a foreign country, compared to how much more difficult it would be vice-versa for the college graduate from Cambodia to backpack through Europe. And I'm not just privileged in terms of money, but also options. Merely because I was born at the specific patch of earth to get a German Passport, I'm able to enter so many countries with so little bureucratic effort. I didn't earn this, do anything for it, that's just given to me.
</p>

<p>
The final privilege is environment. An education at a reknowned university doesn't guarantee professional success, but does increase the chances (even if only connecting you with influencial people or convince recruiters who put a disproportionate value on <em>where</em> you got your degree from). I have no doubt that there are equally capable kids as me in the schools in Cambodia or Vietnam, but imagine the challenges they would have to overcome to e.g. study at ETH. One of the hardest things is to even recognize that as a possibility, because they must do something so radically different than their parents, peers, environment. Then, they have to convince universities of their potential with a foreign report card recruiters can't accurately judge. On top of that, money and Visa will be huge issues. 
</p>


<h4>Everyone is busy with their own shit</h4>
<p>
Everyone is busy with their own life. People don't really think about you that often. I don't say this in a bitter, negative sense, quite the contrary. Realizing that the people in your life are independent humans with their own worries and agendas, mostly not concerning you, takes the pressure off. Do whatever <em>you</em> want and then take full responsiblity for your decisions. Don't make a decision that you'll be stuck with 100% of the time, based on the expectations, sentiments, beliefs of other people that might only be impacted by it 1% of the time. They don't have the skin in the game. And for times you are together with them, you can be best friend, brother, son if you are happy with your own life.
</p>


<h4>Being aware of my bubbles</h4>
<p>
Your environment strongly influences what you view as important. In the last 4 years I nodded in admiring recognition when someone got published in IJRR instead of <em>just</em> RA-L, found it self-evident to dedicate months of my life to optimize not just step-timings, but the gait sequence, had hour-long discussions on the crucial importance of modelling the effects of leg motions on body accelerations. It was super exciting to work on these challenges, but I forgot how much of a niche I was really in. And sometimes you might overblow the amount your research matters to the world. Of course I stomped from the academic robotics bubble right into the backpacker-bubble instead, where dinner conversations revolved about countries visited, breathtaking places you gotta see, local food you must try and that you don't want to go back home. Seeing what people view as important in this enviroment, combined with my previous bubbles, maybe gave me a bit more of a holistic perspective.  
</p>


<h4>Prioritizing Heath</h4>
<p>
I smoked occasionally at the beginning of the travel, as many people in the backpacking community do. I realized that my main reason for smoking was that I enjoyed being able to stand somewhere doing nothing without looking stupid. It was an introvert thing. You're still connected to the people, you can watch them, you can think, but it's not awkward if everyone just silently pulls on that glowing stick. By working on my self-confidence, I can still be in these situations, but without a cigarette in my hand.
</p>

<p>
I hate hangovers. That's why I rarely drank more than a few beer. But if 8 beer cause a terrible hangover, signaling clearly that something in my body is seriously destroyed by the alcohol, then one beer still harms my body 1/8 of the amount &ndash; even if I don't feel it. I'll only accept this health-hazard, if the alcohol I'm drinking is delicious and there's no non-alcoholic alternative. Therefore I'm forever done with shots (juck!) and beer and whine are mostly replaced by tasty fresh-juice. I doubt i'll find an alternativee to a delicious mojito though, yummy! 
</p>

<h4>They're doing it right now</h4>
<p>
I wrote in a <a href="/blog/why-im-travelling">previous post</a> about sampling others ways of living. Travelling gave me a glimpse into what feels like a "Secret(ish) Society". These are backpackers, volunteers, online-teachers, writers, influencers, digital nomads, spread everywhere throughout the world, choosing to just live for a few weeks, months or years a bit different than the rest. They have differenet perks and problems, but nonetheless prove that work, play, life can alternatively be structured and the lines between them blurred. For me it is inspring to realize that they're many more than I thought, and they're living like this <em>right now</em> (my Instragram feed proving it). 
</p>



<h4>Two modes of travelling</h4>
<p>
I noticed for me there are two modes of travelling (read "living"). The first mode is exploration. That's changing hostels every few days, doing tours, sightseeing. It's difficult to get a consistent sleeping routine, or stick to a workout schedule, since there's so much to do, see and everything is always changing. It's exhillerating! But it can also be exhausting. I limit these backpacking sections to 3 weeks, and in that time go all-in: Socialize, participate, explore. But I don't even try to get work done, or sleep long, that's not what I'm there for.
</p>

<p>
The other mode is exploitation. It's about dedicating time to getting something done, aquiring a specific skill, working on your health (also relaxing). For these tasks it's ideal to stay in one place for multiple weeks, get into a routine, be strict with yourself. I did this in Bali where I spent 45 days surfing, trying to eat healthy and learning web development.
</p>

<p>
Of course you can also mix these modes, but it's helpful to be clear in one's mind what, or if, you are currently trying to achieve. Then you don't have to have a bad concience when you're not writing that essay while playing jenga at the hostel, because you know there's a better time for that in an environment that's perfectly tailored to the this objetive.   
</p> 


<h4>Was loneliness an issue?</h4>
<p>
For me not so much. Sightseeing and exploring i prefer with other people, so I tried so sign up for day tours or events directly at the hostel, that was the best way to connect with other travellers. Especially in hostels, there are a bunch of solo travellers that want to connect, so that's rarely an issue if you're confident enough to strike up a conversation. And even during time periods when I wasn't too sociable, being connected to friends and family over skype, whatsapp etc never really makes you feel alone. Technology ftw!
</p>



<h4>Some other points before I forget</h4>
<ul>
	<li>America was the bad guy in Vietnam war.</li>
	<li>Plastic waste is a tangible issue (you literally touch it when swimming) in Bali. </li>
	<li>If choice of bunk bed, always chose bottom.</li>
	<li>Sharing a room with other people is not a problem.</li>
	<li>Partying is not really fun for me anymore.</li>
	<li>4 males can fit on one scooter.</li>
	<li>Even quiet people want to talk, as long as one asks the right questions.</li>
	<li>SE-Asia is super safe. Not one criminal incident in six months.</li>
